# Re-examining the meningitis belt: associations between environmental factors and epidemic meningitis risk across Africa

This repository contains R and Stata code used to create a logistic regression model and risk map for meningitis outbreaks across Africa. A 2002 study by Molesworth et al investigated the spatial distribution of meningitis epidemics in Africa occurring between 1980 and 1999 to determine the geographical risk of meningitis across Africa. This analysis was carried out to  present an update on the associations between environmental variables and meningitis epidemic risk for meningitis across Africa abd to understand if the geography of the meningitis belt and risk factors associated with meningitis have changed.
